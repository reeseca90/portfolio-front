      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>I am a full-stack developer with a long-time passion for learning new things.</p>

      <p>
        Formerly, I was enlisted in the United States Navy. I served as a Nuclear Field Electrician's Mate for 11 years across three duty stations in many roles.&nbsp;
        I started as an operator, maintenance technician, and instructor aboard the MTS-626, a decommissioned nuclear submarine training platform, where I&nbsp;
        reinforced my fundamental maintenance and troubleshooting skills while training junior sailors to operate a nuclear power plant.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I transferred to the aircraft carrier USS John C. Stennis, CVN-74, where I directed the operation of the electrical distribution system aboard the ship&nbsp;
        and supervised all aspects of operation of the nuclear power plant. I served as Electrical Leading Petty Officer of number one propulsion plant, where I&nbsp;
        was responsible for the planning and execution of all electrical maintenance, as well as the training and development of junior personnel.
      </p>
      <p>
        After my tour aboard CVN-74, I transferred to Nuclear Field 'A' School where I taught new students basic electrical theory and fundamentals, as well as&nbsp;
        serving as a section adviser to multiple classes. My last role in the Navy was electrical class director, where I led twelve other sea-returnee sailors&nbsp;
        responsible for all Electrician's Mate students enrolled at the school, including their technical training, military training, and personal development.

      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy running, astronomy, and some video games; you can see some of them in my blog posts. However, most of my free time is&nbsp;
        spent with my family.
